# Magma funcions on quotient modular curves

Different functions for quotient modular curves $X_0(N)/W_N$ with $W_N$ a subgroup of $B(N)$ the full subgroup of all Atkin-Lehner involutions of $X_0(N)$. 

In particular functions to compute genus, $\mathbb{Q}$-Jacobian decomposition, number of points on a finite field of characteristic $p$ with $p\nmid N$, 
and testing by counting points in a finite field if we can discard a degree $d$ map from $X_0(N)/W_N$ to an elliptic curve that appears in the $\mathbb{Q}$-decomposition of the quotient modular curve. The subgroup $W_N$ could be also the trivial subgroup or the full $B(N)$.

## Examples
- Compute number of fixed points of Atkin-Lehner involution $w_d$ on $X_0(366)$ with $(d,N/d)=1$ and the genus of $X_0(366)$
```magma
load "function.m";
N := 366; // Level
d:=61; // d an integer with (d,N/d)=1
d2:=2; // d2 an integer with (d2,N/d2)=1
Fixedsmall:=fixedpointsALinvsmall(N,d2);
print Fixedsmall; // Return the number of fixed points of w_{d2} when d2 is 1,2,3 or 4.
Fixedbig:=fixedpointsALinvbig(N,d);
print Fixedbig; // Return the number of fixed points of w_d when d is strictly bigger than 4
genus:=generexoN(N);
print genus; //Return the genus of X_0(N)
```

- For $X_0(366) / \langle w_{61}, w_2 \rangle$: compute its genus, $\mathbb{Q}$-Jacobian decomposition and number of $\mathbb{F}_{p^n}$-points with $p\nmid N$. See not degree two map over the rationals to the elliptic curve E61a by counting $\mathbb{F}_9$-points of the quotient curve and the elliptic curve.

```magma
load "function.m";
N := 366; // Level
TN := [* 61, 122, 2, 1 *]; // List the elements of the subgroup of involutions
t:=#TN; //Order of the subgroup of involutions
genusquotientcurve:=genereX0NQuotientWN(N,TN,t);
print genusquotientcurve; // Return the genus of the quotient modular curve X0(N)/TN
prec := 20; // Number of coefficients of the q-expansion
HH := JacobianDecompositionQuotientX0NWN(N, TN, prec, t);
print HH[1]; // Should return 11111111111111 if compute the exact Jacobian decomposition (if one factor appears n times, appears n times in Jacobian decomposition)
// If return 0 then each factor appears in Jacobian decomposition BUT if one factors appears n times in Jacob.decom, here could appear m times with m ge n.
//For N square free as our example should appear 11111111111 and compute the programme directly the Jacobian decomposition
print HH[2]; // List the modular forms with q-expansion that are factor of the Jacobian, (could appear repeated if some factor of the Jacobian can appeared repeated)
print HH[3]; // List the number fields of the list of modular forms given in HH[2], the order is the same 
p:=3;// A prime number not dividing the level N
bound:=20;// For bound n where we will compute F_{p^n} points of the modular curve
FpnpointsQuotientCurve:=FpnpointsforQuotientcurveX0NWN(N,p,HH[2],HH[3],bound);
print FpnpointsQuotientCurve; //List the number of F_{p^n}-points for the modular curve X0(N)/TN for n=1 until bound IF HH[1]= 11111111111111
degree:=2; // degree of the map of Quotient curve to elliptic curve
apcoefficient:=-2;// Corresponds to E61a the a_p-coefficient of the q-expansion of the associated modular form which appears in Jacobian decomposition of quotient modular curve
NondegreedmaptoEC:=MapdegreedtoEC(p,degree,bound,apcoefficient,FpnpointsQuotientCurve);
print NondegreedmaptoEC ;// List if any of the set (p^n, Integer) n<bound such that |X_0(N)/W_N(F_{p^n})|-degree*|EllipticCurve(F_{p^n})|=Integer, thus no degree map //between quotient modular curve to such elliptic curve defined over the rationals if the list is not empty, recall p does not divide N. In the example with
//this method we know that there is no degree two map over the rationals from X_0(366)/<w_61,w_2> to the elliptic curve E61a, by use F_9-points.
```
- For $X_0(308)/\langle w_4,w_7 \rangle$: compute its genus, $\mathbb{Q}$-Jacobian decomposition and number of $\mathbb{F}_{p^n}$-points with $p\nmid N$. On non existence of degree $d$ maps to certain elliptic curves that appears in the Jacobian decomposition.
